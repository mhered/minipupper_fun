# A 3D-printed Bull Skin for Mini Pupper

## Why?
The original idea came to me when I saw this tweet by [@nisshan_](https://twitter.com/nisshan_).

It would be fun to dress up the MiniPupper!

However, the shape of Mini Pupper reminds me more of a bull, so I decided to make a 3D-printed Bull Skin for my Mini Pupper. 

Seems like the perfect excuse to learn about CAD and 3D printing...

## Install FreeCAD

I need some CAD software to run in Ubuntu, and it seems that [a good alternative could be FreeCAD](https://itsfoss.com/cad-software-linux/)

```
$ sudo apt-get install freecad
```
It's a 679Mb download - about 20'.

Mouse navigation is not immediately obvious. I configured the Navigation style to Inventor (refer to https://wiki.freecad.org/)

**Note: I can visualize but not download [the Fusion360 files of the Mini Pupper](https://a360.co/3fS15a1). Why? For later...**

* Downloaded the STL of a bull: https://www.ameede.net/bull-low-poly-b003554-file-stl-free-download-3d-model-for-cnc-and-3d/, but it is asymmetrical (head, torso turned)

* Main inspiration for the robot bull [Behance - Mechanical bull - 3d model](https://www.behance.net/gallery/27627969/Mechanical-bull-3d-model)

## Next steps
- [ ]  get CAD models
  - [ ] download Fusion 360 files
  - [ ] check CAD model in CHAMP
  - [ ] convert STL files (but then I will need also dimensions)
- [ ] do some FreeCAD tutorials
- [ ] draft design for the bull skin
- [ ] merge bull skin with existing parts
- [ ] preprocess for 3D printing
- [ ] print
- [ ] test!
- [ ] iterate!
