## Start raspberry pi

- Connect the Raspberry pi to the display with a microHDMI cable.
- Connect a USB keyboard and mouse to the Raspberry pi. 
- Press and hold the button on the bottom of the Mini Pupper to  start Raspberry pi for three seconds. 
- If you can see Ubuntu running on your screen, you have succeeded. You should also see the face on Mini Pupper display. If you donâ€™t see  both screen, then you have followed the instructions incorrectly.

## Log in

- Press ubuntu on the purple screen to log in.
- Default username : `ubuntu`
- Default password : `mangdang`
- You should change your password.

## Enable wifi

- Press the menu button at the bottom left and type terminal to  start the terminal. In the terminal, open the configuration file. 

```bash
$ sudo nano /boot/firmware/syscfg.txt
```
- Type # to comment out the line disabling wifi on `syscfg.txt` 
```
  # dtoverlay=disable-wifi
```
- Reboot Ubuntu for changes to take effect.
- When you start up again, open settings and set up your wifi  settings. Choose your wifi access point SSID and enter your password. 
- Type `ip a`. See and make a note of IP address. This will be  necessary when you connect to your PC via ssh. The configuration within  Ubuntu is now complete.

## Wifi problems

RPi connects to Wifi and after a few seconds connection is interrupted with the message: `Connection failed.  Activation of network connection failed.`

It is recovered after rebooting the RPi. Happens with the main router and also with a mobile connection. All other devices work fine.

Possible solutions:

* From [the official documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.html#configuring-networking):

> Note that on Raspberry Pi devices that support the 5GHz band (Pi3B+,  Pi4, CM4, Pi400), wireless networking is disabled for regulatory  reasons, until the country code has been set. 
>
> To set the country code,  open the `Raspberry Pi Configuration` application from the Preferences Menu, select **Localisation** and set the appropriate code.

Couldn't find this option, and setting Date&Time as per Solution 5 described [here](https://appuals.com/activation-of-network-connection-failed-in-linux/)  didn't work:

Settings -> Date & Time -> Toggle Automatic Date & Time and set Time Zone

* Reinstalling `network-manager` as suggested [here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1062390/activation-of-network-connection-failed-for-ethernet-connection)  didn't work either:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install --reinstall network-manager ; sudo reboot now
```

* [turning off WLAN power saving](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/269661/how-to-turn-off-wireless-power-management-permanently/315400#315400) as  suggested [here](https://techenclave.com/threads/wifi-activation-of-network-connection-failed.199880/)

```bash
$ sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/default-wifi-powersave-on.conf
```

## Questions

Why fan does not work with battery? ->it does work, sometimes

Can I continue to work while plugged in?

Can I plug directly the RPi?

**NOTE: should not switch off robot by pusing the power button from battery, it could destroy thr SD!! Do shutdown instead from SSH or press & hold the remote triangle button.** [ThousanDIY](https://note.com/tomorrow56/n/nf83edb723a08)


## Open ports for ssh

- Attempt to make an ssh connection from your PC to Ubuntu. 
```
ssh ubuntu@192.168.x.x -p 22
```

- If you are unable to make an ssh connection from your PC, you  will need to configure the following, maybe.
```
sudo ufw allow 22
sudo ufw reload
```
- If firewall is not running, do the following.
```
sudo ufw enable
```

## run headless

I want to do an headless calibration, by remoting into MiniPupper
I have no problem SSH through ethernet, I would have no problems setting up the WiFi.
I installed xRDP to use remote desktop, but it results in a black screen. It has something to do with the ubuntu user automatically logging in, and remote clients being junky. I'm trying to remove the automatic login/adding users, to no avail for now.
Was someone able to remote into MiniPupper desktop?
SOLUTION:

* edit config file using ssh 

```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu-desktop:~$ sudo nano /etc/gdm3/custom.conf
```

Then comment out with # the two autologin lines:

```
# AutomaticLoginEnable=true
# AutomaticLogin=ubuntu
```

```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu-desktop:~$ sudo reboot now
```

now remote desktop works using "ubuntu" "mangdang" user
to run calibration run inside a console on the remote desktop 
"xhost +"
"sudo python3 /home/ubuntu/Robotics/QuadrupedRobot/StanfordQuadruped/calibrate_tool.py"
The calibration application runs and I can move all twelve servos using sliders.



I found a way that works with Ubuntu 21.10. There is a configuration file that can be edited from ssh that disables the autologin. Reboot. Then  remote desktop is able to get into MiniPupper with the ubuntu user  credentials. But I don't have desktop icons.Next snag is that the calibration script cannot create a windows because tkinter gets confused.

first install xRDP

 then edit the configuration file /etc/gdm3/custom.confcomment 

with # the AutomaticLoginEnable and AutomaticLogin

this way ubuntu doesn't log in locally when RPI4 is powered, and I can log  in from remote desktop  with "ubuntu" user and not get a black screen."xhost +" command is required before running "sudo python3  /home/ubuntu/Robotics/QuadrupedRobot/StanfordQuadruped/calibrate_tool.py" otherwise tkinter gets confused because sudo is in another virtual  desktop, and xhost disables all securities of xwindow (as far as i  understand)
